# IntroToR
Introductory exercises to R programming for Data Analytics. Students need to have R and RStudio installed before starting the exercises.

## How to use these scripts

These scripts should be used by the mentor as a guide while asking students to type code. 

Google is allowed & students should have a printed copy of the "Base R cheat sheet" (https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf). 

Once a student completes some code, they can write it in the whiteboard and comment it with the rest of the cohort and with the mentor.

Students should write their code in a script (not directly in the console) with comments, and save this script as a resource that they will certainly need later!

Some of this exercises have been inspired by the book "Hands On Programming with R", which is available for free online: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr
